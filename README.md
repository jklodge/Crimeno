# GA WDI-32 Project 4 - CrimeNo

For our final project, we were given a week to build a MERN Stack web application that allowed users to log in, and used third party APIs to display some data.

#### [Visit website](http://www.crimeno.com/) on mobile or desktop for best viewing experience.

###### CrimeNo is a web application where users can upload any crime they've experienced including the area and any details. The crime is then plotted on the map on the index page and users can check and continue to add crimes to raise awareness.

Users can also use a heatmap which is connected to the Police api and shows the density of crime in that area.


The app is optimised for mobile, as it was designed mobile-first.

##### API Information

I combined the google maps and police api to provide a map and location journey for users. Users can now easily plot and discover crime in their area, although I have initially focused on London.
